# 09_Customer-Support-Case-Type-Classification_202401100400029
This repository implements a machine learning pipeline using a Random Forest Classifier for classification tasks. It covers essential steps such as data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The pipeline begins by cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and detecting outliers. 
Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and detects outliers in the dataset.

Model Training: Trains a Random Forest Classifier on the preprocessed data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluates the model using multiple metrics:

Accuracy: Measures the overall correctness of the model.

Precision, Recall, F1 Score: Evaluates class-wise performance.

Confusion Matrix: Displays the count of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

Classification Report: Provides a detailed performance breakdown per class.

ROC-AUC: Measures the model's ability to distinguish between classes (especially for binary classification).

Requirements:
Python 3.x

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn
